Send your friends to the gulag!

## Usage
```
!gulag <member>
```

The gulag command starts a vote to throw a member in the gulag. The number of required votes to send a
member to the gulag can be set in architus's settings. Every vote over the required threshold will add
to the amount of time spent in the gulag.

In order to use this command, the gulag emoji must be set in architus's settings. Voting will then
take place by reacting to architus's message with the set emoji.
